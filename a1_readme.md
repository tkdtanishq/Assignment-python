I am going to use this file to describe the functionality of my programs of:

ASSIGNMENT-1

Task1.py:
From line 1 -> 4, I have written what I am going to do in the code and tell you about the expected output, then in line 6 and 7, I have asked the user to input the numbers we are going to use to perform the mathematical operations, from line 8 to 11, 14, and 15, I have written the code which performs the operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Division can be performed in 2 ways: float division and floor division. In the 11th line, we have performed the float division that gives the float value, and while printing it, I have set the output to give the value up to 2 decimal places using the round function. In the 14th line, I have performed the floor division that only gives the whole value,then: the 15th line covers the modulus part of giving the remainder.

Task2.py:
From line 1 -> 5, I have written what I am going to do in the code and tell you about the expected output, then in line 7 and 8, I have asked the user to input their first and last name. In the 9th line: I have performed String Concatenation and afterwards printed the output.
