I am going to use this file to describe the functionality of my programs of:

ASSIGNMENT-2
Task1:
1. We have first asked the user for the integer(data type:int) and stored it a variable 'n',
2. then using the if-else conditions we have processed our input and shown the result:
   if: checks whether the number when divided by 2 give 0; if yes then it prints " n(input) is an Even number"
   else: will work if the 'if' condition is false, then the statements/blocks under then else would be executed,like; "n is an Odd number"
NOTE: We dont repeat if continously to make our program more sturctured, accurate and fast.

Task2:
1. In the very beginning we have declared a variable 's' that stores the value: 0, which will come handy in the next steps,
2. using the for loop in order to run from (initial to final-1): covering the results from 1 to 50(ignores 51),
3. under the for loop we have performed: s=s+i(s+=i), which will run the number of times the for loop works:
   example: intially s was equal to 0, at the time i=1 it was like: s=0+1, which mean that s=1, similarly when i=2: s=1+2, and soon on-till the      loop ends.
4. At the time, the loop ended: s=sum of the numbers from 1 to 50,s=1275.
