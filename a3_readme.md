I am going to use this file to describe the functionality of my programs of:

ASSIGNMENT-3
Task 1:
We have first defined the function called 'factorial' with the argument 'num', setting up a condition that checks if the value of num (input of the user) is either equal to 0 or 1; it will return 1, as the factorial of 0 and 1 is equal to 1. If not, then the function calls itself until the value of num reaches the base condition.
Outside the function definition (line 12 & 13), we ask the user to input the number, then process the number under the function defined above.

Task 2:
Importing the module math to use the functions (log, sin, sqrt) it contains.
Defining the functions:
sq_root: if n is equal to 0, it returns 0; else, it proceeds with the calculations by using the function 'sqrt' from the math module.
The same applies to the log and sine functions.
Taking the input from the user: if the entered value is negative, it does not proceed with the calculation and asks the user to input a positive number; else, it prints the values after running the value through the defined functions.
